just how to make greatness straight out the gate im bout to break it down aint no mistakes allowed but make no mistake im bout to rape the alphabet i may raise some brows if i press the issue just to get the anger out brrr full magazine could take staples out savage but aint thinkin bout no bank account but bitch im off the chain like kala brown  motherfucker shut the fuck up when im talkin lil bitch im sorry wait whats your talent oh critiquin my talent oh bitch i dont know who the fuck yall are to give a sub par bar even have an opinion or view you mention me millions of views attention in

just an mc maybe stan just isnt your cup of tea get it maybe your cups full of syrup and lean maybe i need to stir up shit preferably shake the world up if it were up to me paul wants me to chill yall want me to ill i should eat a pill probably i will old me killed the new me watch him bleed to death i breathe on the mirror i dont see my breath possibly im dead i must be possessed like an evil spell im e v i l evil but spelled  jam a crest whitestrip in the tip of my dick with an ice pick stick it in a vice grip hang it on a spike fence bang it with a pipe wrench while i take my ballsack and flick it like a light switch like vice president mike pence back up on my shit in a sidekick as i lay it on a spike strip  these are things that id rather do than hear you on a mic since nine tenths of your rhyme is about ice and jesus christ man how many times is someone gonna fuck on my bitch fuck my side chick  you wont ever see em icy but as cold as i get on the m i c i polarize shit so the temps might freeze and your skull might split like i bashed you upside it bitch i got the club on smash like a nightstick yeah  turn down for what i aint loud enough nah turn the valium up cause i dont know how im gonna get your mouths to shut now when it doesnt matter what caliber i spit at ill bet a hundred thousand bucks youll turn around and just be like man how the fuck sourpuss gonna get mad just cause his album sucks and now he wants to take it out on us ooh ooh  but last week an ex fan mailed me a copy of the mathers lp to tell me to study itll help me get back to myself and shell love me ooh ooh i mailed the bitch back and said if i did that id just be like everyone else in the fucking industry especially an effing recovery clone of me  so finger bang chicken wang mgk igg azae lil pump lil xan imitate lil wayne i should aim at everybody in the game pick a name im fed up with being humble and rumor is im hungry im sure you heard bumblings i heard you wanna rumble like an empty stomach i heard your mumblin but its jumbled in mumbo jumbo the era that im from will pummel you thats what its comin to what the fuck youre gonna do when you run into it im gonna crumble you and ill take a number two and dump on you if you aint joyner if you aint kendrick or cole or sean then youre a goner im bout to bring it to anyone in this bitch who want it i guess when you walk into bk you expect a whopper you can order a quarter pounder when you go to mcdonalds but if youre lookin to get a porterhouse you better go get revival but yall are acting like i tried to serve you up a slider maybe the vocals should have been auto tuned and you would have bought it but sayin i no longer got it cause you missed a lot and never caught it cause it went over your head because youre too stupid to get it cause youre mentally retarded but pretend to be the smartest with your expertise and knowledge but youll never be an artist and im harder on myself than you could ever be regardless what ill never be is flawless all ill ever be is honest even when im gone theyre gonna say i brought it even when i hit my forties like a fuckin alcoholic with a bottle full of malt liquor but i couldnt bottle this shit any longer the fact that i know that ima hit my bottom if i dont pull myself from the jaws of defeat and rise to my feet i dont see why yall even started with me

wanna say welcome to the slaughterhouse bitch yeah invite them in like a one a day im not done preach cause i feel like the beast of burden that line in the sand was it even worth it cause the way i see people turnings is makin it seem worthless its startin to defeat the purpose im watchin my fan base shrink to thirds and i was just tryin to do the right thing but word has the court of public opinion reached a verdict or still yet to be determined cause im determined to be me critiqued or worshiped but if i could go back id at least reword it and say i empathize with the people this evil serpent sold the dream to that hes deserted  but i think its workin these verses are makin him a wee bit nervous and hes too scurred to answer me with words cause he knows that he will lyrically get murdered but i know at least hes heard it cause agent orange just sent the secret service to meet in person to see if i really think of hurtin him or ask if im linked to terrorists i said only when it comes to ink and lyricists but my beef is more media journalists hold up hold up hold up… i said my beef is more meaty a journalist can get a mouthful of flesh and yes i mean eating a penis cause they been pannin my album to death so i been givin the media fingers dont wanna turn this to a counseling sesh but they been puttin me through the ringer so i aint ironin shit out with the press but i just

vice president mike pence back up on my shit in a sidekick as i lay it on a spike strip  these are things that id rather do than hear you on a mic since nine tenths of your rhyme is about ice and

dump on you if you aint joyner if you aint kendrick or cole or sean then youre a goner im bout to bring it to anyone in this bitch who want it i guess when you walk into bk you expect a whopper you can order a quarter pounder when you go to mcdonalds but if youre lookin to get a porterhouse you better go get revival but yall are acting like i tried to serve you up a slider maybe the vocals should have been auto tuned and you would have bought it but sayin i no longer got it cause you missed a lot and never caught it cause it went over your head because youre too stupid to get it cause youre mentally retarded but pretend to be the smartest with your expertise and knowledge but youll never be an artist and im harder on myself than you could ever be regardless what ill never be is flawless all ill ever be is honest even when im gone theyre gonna say i brought it even when i hit my forties like a fuckin alcoholic with a bottle full of malt liquor but i couldnt bottle this shit any longer the fact that i know that ima hit my bottom if i dont pull myself from the jaws of defeat and rise to my feet i dont see why yall even started with me i get in beefs my enemies die i dont cease fire til at least all are deceased im east side never be caught slippin now you see why i dont sleep not even a wink i dont blink i dont doze off i dont even nod to the beats i dont even close

slaughterhouse bitch yeah invite them in like a one a day im not done preach cause i feel like the beast of burden that line in the sand was it even worth it cause the way i see people turnings is makin it seem worthless its startin to defeat the purpose im watchin my fan base shrink to thirds and i was just tryin to do the right thing but word has the court of public opinion reached a verdict or still yet to be determined cause im determined to be me critiqued or worshiped but if i could go back id at least reword it and say i empathize with the people this evil serpent sold the dream to that hes deserted  but i think its workin these verses are makin him a wee bit nervous and hes too scurred to answer me with words cause he knows that he will lyrically get murdered but i know at least hes heard it cause agent orange just sent the secret service to meet in person to see if i really think of hurtin him or ask if im linked to terrorists i said only when it comes to ink and lyricists but my beef is more media journalists hold up hold up hold up… i said my beef is more meaty a journalist can get a mouthful of flesh and yes i mean eating a penis cause they been pannin my album to death so i been givin the media fingers dont wanna turn this to a counseling sesh but they been puttin me through the ringer so i aint ironin shit out with the press but i just took this beat

320,320,Eminem,Stepping Stone," 
 take me to the river yeah yeah yeah yeah  its 2002 everything was totally new we were globally huge watching sales go through the roof we wrote and we feuded runyon avenue soldiers included a multitude of homies who would bounce for no good excuse we were so bulletproof wrote souped and soaked in our youth thought we was running shit til we lost the sole of our shoe the death of doody broke us in two we were thrown for a loop aint none of us know what to do and at the time i was going through my own struggles too so i wasnt in no condition to be coaching us through everyone tried to go solo really nobody blew i was hoping they do so i aint have to shoulder the crew the plan was put everyone in position so that they knew how to stand on their own and i dont wanna open up wounds i just noticed that oomph was gone when we go in the booth cause the truth is the moment that proof died so did the group shoot…  if i could leave this all behind i could open up my eyes and walk in a straight line down to the river with you help me leave this all behind  ima wash away my sins ima rinse away this dirt i forgot to make amends to all the friends i may have hurt i better stop and say my grace from it i pray that i dont fall cause on the way back down i may end up running back into them all i never meant to use you all as my stepping stones  it was never the same and its bothered me since and the farther we drift apart the more awkward it gets the more time goes by the more life happens and we gotta be men we got responsibilities plus we dont say how we feel and i feel like this is what got us in the debacle were in been with you guys thick and thin but its almost as if sometimes were not even friends which reminded me biz rockstar was the shit yall coulda got you a hit without me on the shit if you woulda put d12 on it wish i coulda did more than try talking you into coming up off of it i know it wasnt my fault but part of it probably is i think of all of the trips to bet and the rappers i wish that we woulda politicked with maybe yall coulda clicked and got you some features but thats water under the bridge but im washing my sins in it til my conscience is cleansed  if i could leave this all behind i could open up my eyes and walk in a straight line down to the river with you help me leave this all behind  ima wash away my sins ima rinse away this dirt i forgot to make amends to all the friends i may have hurt i better stop and say my grace from it i pray that i dont fall cause on the way back down i may end up running back into them all i never meant to use you all as my stepping stones  bacardi and hen never thought the party would end one minute youre bodying shit but then your audience splits you can already sense the climate is starting to shift to these kids you no longer exist went from rainin cats and dogs in this bitch to tiny drops little drips and by the time your reign is over youll hardly be missed you start thinking of all the artists you dissed all the carnage you left is this the kind of karma you get for turning your fucking back on bizzy kuniva and swift a freudian slip subconsciously i honestly wished i aint feel so much guilt and yall didnt harbor resentment but its hard to pretend that yall aint got none i just wish i had words but i guess there just are none for this to my partners i cant say how sorry i am this is not how i planned for our story to end i love all of you men but i just cant be the guy everybody depends on for entire careers cause thats not even fair i will always be here but that spark isnt there and i dont know how to recapture that time and that era ive tried hearkening back to but im fighting for air im barely charting myself feels like im on the descent but it was not my intent to treat yall like a stepping stone though i aint left no one behind but we been down every road done all we possibly can i know we kept our hopes up but the longer we spend living this lie that we live the less is left for closure so lets let this go its not goodbye to our friendship but d12 is over  ima wash away my sins ima rinse away this dirt i forgot to make amends to all the friends i may have hurt i better stop and say my grace from it i pray that i dont fall cause on the way back down i may end up running back into them all i never meant to use you all as my stepping stones i never meant to make you feel like my stepping stones i never meant to use you all for my stepping stones ","['take', 'river', 'yeah', 'yeah', 'yeah', 'yeah', '2002', 'everything', 'totally', 'globally',

375,375,Eminem Lyrics,Walk On Water,   i walk on water but i aint no jesus i walk on water but only when it freezes fuck   why are expectations so high is it the bar i set my arms i stretch but i cant reach a far cry from it or its in my grasp but as soon as i grab squeeze i lose my grip like the flyin trapeze into the dark i plummet now the skys blackenin i know the marks high butterflies rip apart my stomach knowin that no matter what bars i come with youre gonna harp gripe and thats a hard vicodin to swallow so i scrap these as pressure increases like khakis i feel the ice cracking because   i walk on water but i aint no jesus its the curse of the its the curse of the i walk on water shit but only when it freezes   its the curse of the standard that the first of the mathers disc set always in search of the verse that i havent spit yet will this step just be another misstep to tarnish whatever the legacy love or respect ive garnered the rhyme has to be perfect the delivery flawless and it always feels like im hittin the mark til i go sit in the car listen and pick it apart like this shit is garbage gods given me all this still i feel no different regardless kids look to me as a god this is retarded if only they knew its a facade and its exhaustive and i try not to listen to nonsense but if you bitches are tryin to strip me of my confidence mission accomplished im not god sent nas rakim pac big james todd smith and im not prince so   i walk on water but i aint no jesus i walk on water its true im a rubiks its true but only when it freezes its true  cause im only human just like you making my mistakes oh if you only knew i dont think you should believe in me the way that you do cause im terrified to let you down oh   its true im a rubiks a beautiful mess at times juvenile yes i goof and i jest a flawed human i guess but im doin my best to not ruin your expectations and meet em but first the speedom verse now big sean hes going too fast is he gonna shout or curse out his mom there was a time i had the world by the balls eating out my palm every album song i was spazzin the fuck out on and now im gettin clowned and frowned on but the only one whos looking down on me that matters nows deshaun am i lucky to be around this long begs the question though especially after the methadone as yesterday fades and the dresden home is burnt to the ground and all thats left of my house is lawn the crowds are gone and its time to wash out the blonde sales decline the curtains drawn theyre closing the set im still poking my head from out behind and everyone who has doubt remind now take your best rhyme outdo it now do it a thousand times now let em tell ya the world no longer cares or gives a fuck about your rhymes and as i grow outta sight outta mind i might go outta mine cause how do i ever let this mic go without a fight when i made a fuckin tightrope outta twine but when i do fall from these heights though ill be fine i wont pout or
